# Parallel Loading 
In these types of registers we can perform shifting and buffering independently, The Control logic enables wether it is to buffer or shift with `LOAD` or `SHL` logic. These circuits gives more control over the registers rather than using a single functioning buffer or a shift register.

**note:Using both `LOAD` and `SHL` high at the same time is forbidden.**
